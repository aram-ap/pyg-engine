## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### The switch to Rust
This is it, we're switching to Rust. Moving ahead from version 1.1.0,
which brought pyg-engine a c++ backing. 
Why am I doing this? 
- The c++ backing wasn't all that developed yet, meaning there's not too much work being lost.
- Rust is personally a really compelling option. I haven't learned it thoroughly yet, so this is my opportunity. 
- F#@K dependency management with c++.
